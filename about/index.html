	<p>As a social scientist by training, researcher by profession and data nerd by accident,
		I'm facinated by complex socio-technical systems, the techniques we can use to understand them
		 and the people who cooperate to build them.</p>

	<p> This fascination has led me on a rather non-traditional <a href="/resume">educational and professional</a> route
		 towards data science. I began my journey as an <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/engineering/undergraduate/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics.page">Aeronautics and Astronautics</a>
		 undergraduate enamoured with space exploration, before making the decision to switch to
		 <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/politics/undergraduate/index.page">Politics and International Relations</a> in order
		 to study the complex and emergent systems of human organisation. In pursuit of this degree, I discovered a (suprising) interest in statistics,
		 a passion for complex systems approaches and an appreciation for anarchist political philosophy (of all things).</p>

 <p> Following my undergrad, I fell into the world of data through working at the <a href="theodi.org">Open Data Institute</a>.
	  It was here that I not only developed a keen passion for the 'open movement' but also uncovered an unreasonable level of excitement
		around seemingly dry data topics (data standards, yay!). I spent four years at the ODI <a href="/publications">doing research</a>,
		<a href="/talks">giving talks</a> and advising businesses and governments about how (carefully) increasing access to data
		can bring significant benefits to both organisations and wider society.</p>

	<p> Inspired by the many ways data is being used in society for good and frustrated by the seeming lack of appropriate methods to study these uses,
		I resolved to return to university. I enrolled in Oxford University's <a href="https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/study/msc-in-social-science-of-the-internet/">
		MSc Social Science of the Internet program</a>, based in the world-leading, multidisciplinary
		<a href="https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford Internet Institute</a>. Here, I was given the opportunity to explore cutting-edge computational
		social	science methodologies and actively apply them to complex internet-based phenomena, including courses in
		social network analysis, agent-based modelling and big data analytics. Following an interest I developed at the ODI, throughout the degree I focused my attention
		on the practices of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_production">peer-production</a>, and in particular the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap
		project</a>. My thesis and several papers I wrote on the topic can be found on this <a href="/projects">site</a>.
	</p>

 	<p>In my spare time I like to ski and hike (mandatory for BC residents), play
		boardgames (mandatory for millennial nerds) and drink overly pricey craft beers
		(madatory for ex-East London cultural hipsters). On occassion I also like to travel, dabble in
		<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/129714065@N05/">photography</a> and play around with wire sculptures.</p>
