	<p>As a social scientist by training, researcher by profession and data nerd by accident,
		I'm facinated by complex socio-technical systems, the way people cooperate and
		the techniques we can use to understand them.</p>

	<p><a href="/resume">Educationally and professionally</a>, I've jumped around a bit. During my undergrad,
		I switched from stdying aeronautical engineering to politics, discovering along
		way that I actually (really) enjoyed statistics. I fell into the world of data while working
		at the <a href="theodi.org">Open Data Institute</a>, uncovering worrying levels
		of excitement for some seemingly dry topics (data standards, yay!). I spent four years at the ODI
		<a href="/publications">doing research</a>, <a href="/talks">giving talks</a> and providing advice
		to businesses and governments about how (carefully) increasing access to data can bring about great benefits
		to society.</p>

	<p>Being surrounded by data experts and other clever people doing exciting things with data,
		I felt inspired to improve my own technical and policy skills by going back to university. In 2018, I
		enrolled in Oxford University's <a href="https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/study/msc-in-social-science-of-the-internet/">
		MSc Social Science of the Internet program</a>. Based in the world-leading, multidisciplinary
		<a href="https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford Internet Institute</a>, I mainly focused on
		improving my skills in computational social science methods, including courses in
		social network analysis, agent-based modelling, accessing data, big data analytics etc.</p>

	<p>Based on my work at the ODI, I became enthralled with the concept of peer-production,
	where individuals widely distributed around the world come together to produce a collective, openly
	available output without any direct financial incentive. Because I find these systems so fascinating,
	during the degree I	focused on the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap project</a> in many of
	my papers and my thesis (some of which are detailed on this <a href="/projects">site</a>), leading one professor to
	joke that I have an MSc in OpenStreetMap studies.
	</p>

 	<p>In my spare time I like to ski and hike (mandatory for BC residents), play
		boardgames (mandatory for millennial nerds) and drink overly pricey craft beers
		(madatory for ex-East London cultural hipsters). On occassion I also dabble in
		photography and play around with wire sculptures.</p>
