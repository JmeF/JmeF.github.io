# Summary

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a global project which aims to create a free, openly licensed database of geographic information through mass collaboration. It is an example of ‘social production of knowledge’, similar to Wikipedia or Open Source Software (OSS) (Benkler, 2006). Haythornthwaite (2009) argues that all social production projects exist on a spectrum between crowd and community models. Crowd-based models rely primarily on large numbers of lightweight or casual contributors, whereas community models depend on smaller numbers of heavyweight or serious contributors. Understanding where a particular project sits on this spectrum can have significant impact on the way they design systems and allocate limited resources (Kittur, Chi, Pendleton, Suh, & Mytkowicz, 2007).
