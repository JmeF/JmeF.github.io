## Summary
- wanted to create a personal website to show off projects
- wanted to learn more about web-dev, Git and GitHub, bit of Ruby
- Went for the basics + low cost


## Methods
- Jekyll (Ruby), Github pages,Atom
- Web management -  managing domains + emails
- Git + GitHub - definitely helped me grasp this

## Limitations
- Perfect is enemy of good but iterative approaches also have costs - trying to do the right thing and then discovering new features (flexboxes)
- Not new technologies+ not effective learning of best practice
- Would be nice to have a way to manage updates a bit better (sure I could do this with more time)


## Reflections
- Software skills can be (relatively) easily to translate
- Code examples and how-tos are really useful for getting started, stackoverflow and documentation are so useful
- Probably would use templates in future and pick newer technologies
