## Summary


## Background

## Research questions
Three questions --

1) Is participation in the forum linked to increased edit productivity?

2) Is increased forum participation linked to increased edit productivity?

3) Is increased embeddedness in the community linked to increased edit productivity?

## Findings
1)
2)
3)

## Methods

- Account identification
- IHS transforms
- Significant networks

Not publishing code on this (very badly documented) but happy to publish snippets if asked.

## Limitations and improvements

## Reflections
- DOCUMENT!
